function validate_knobs(K) %#ok<INUSD>
%VALIDATE_KNOBS Stub for sanity checking knob values.
%   VALIDATE_KNOBS(K) should examine the struct of knob parameters and
%   warn or error when values fall outside supported ranges. Typical
%   validations include ensuring batch sizes are positive, learning rates
%   are within reasonable limits, and sequence lengths are supported by
%   the embedding models. This stub performs no validation.
