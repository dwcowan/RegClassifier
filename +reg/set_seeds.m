function S = set_seeds(seed) %#ok<INUSD>
%SET_SEEDS Stub for establishing reproducible random seeds.
%   S = SET_SEEDS(seed) should initialise MATLAB's random number
%   generators using the provided seed and return a struct describing the
%   seeds applied. Implementations may also seed parallel or GPU RNGs as
%   required. This stub returns an empty struct and performs no seeding.
S = struct();
