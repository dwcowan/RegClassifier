function K = load_knobs(jsonPath) %#ok<INUSD>
%LOAD_KNOBS Stub for loading tunable parameters from JSON.
%   K = LOAD_KNOBS(jsonPath) should return a struct of knob values read
%   from the given JSON file. Typical fields include BERT, Projection,
%   FineTune and Chunk each containing algorithm-specific parameters.
%   The function is expected to:
%       1. Read a JSON file containing knob definitions.
%       2. Decode the JSON into a MATLAB struct.
%       3. Return the struct for downstream use.
%   This stub leaves K empty; implementers should provide the actual
%   loading logic.
K = struct();
