# Step 1: Environment & Tooling

**Goal:** Prepare a reproducible MATLAB workspace.

**Depends on:** None.

## Instructions
Refer to [Master Scaffold](master_scaffold.md) for stub modules and test skeletons before beginning this step.

1. Install **MATLAB R2024a** on your workstation.
2. During installation, add these toolboxes:
   - Text Analytics
   - Deep Learning
   - Statistics and Machine Learning
   - Database
   - Parallel Computing
   - Report Generator (optional: Computer Vision)
3. From the MATLAB Add-On Explorer, install *Deep Learning Toolbox Model for BERT-Base, English*.
4. Launch MATLAB and verify GPU access:
   ```matlab
   gpuInfoStruct = gpuDevice;
   ```
   The command should list your CUDA-enabled GPU (e.g., RTX 4060 Ti).
5. Save a snapshot of installed products for future reference:
   ```matlab
   productsTbl = ver;
   ```

## Function Interface
### gpuDevice
- **Parameters:** none
- **Returns:** struct describing the active GPU.
- **Side Effects:** selects the GPU device for subsequent operations.
- **Usage Example:**
  ```matlab
  gpuInfoStruct = gpuDevice;
  ```

### ver
- **Parameters:** none
- **Returns:** table listing installed MATLAB products.
- **Side Effects:** prints version information to the console.
- **Usage Example:**
  ```matlab
  productsTbl = ver;
  ```

Subsequent modules rely on this environment. See [Identifier Registry â€“ Data Contracts](identifier_registry.md#data-contracts) for data artifacts produced later in the pipeline.

## Verification
- `gpuInfoStruct` reports a supported GPU and its memory.
- `productsTbl` lists all required toolboxes and the BERT add-on.

Continue to [Step 2: Repository Setup](step02_repository_setup.md).
