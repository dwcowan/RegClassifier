# Step 1: Environment & Tooling

**Goal:** Prepare a reproducible MATLAB workspace.

**Depends on:** None.

## Instructions
Refer to [Master Scaffold](master_scaffold.md) for stub modules and test skeletons before beginning this step.

Consult `README_NAMING.md` and update `docs/identifier_registry.md` for any new identifiers introduced in this step.

1. Install **MATLAB R2024a** on your workstation.
2. During installation, add these toolboxes:
   - Text Analytics
   - Deep Learning
   - Statistics and Machine Learning
   - Database
   - Parallel Computing
   - Report Generator (optional: Computer Vision)
3. From the MATLAB Add-On Explorer, install *Deep Learning Toolbox Model for BERT-Base, English*.
4. Launch MATLAB and verify GPU access:
  ```matlab
  gpuInfoStruct = gpuDevice;
  ```
  The command populates `gpuInfoStruct` with your CUDA-enabled GPU (e.g., RTX 4060 Ti).
5. Save a snapshot of installed products to `productsTbl` for future reference:
   ```matlab
   productsTbl = ver;
   ```

## Function Interface
### gpuDevice
- **Parameters:** none
- **Returns:** struct describing the active GPU (`gpuInfoStruct`).
- **Side Effects:** selects the GPU device for subsequent operations.
- **Usage Example:**
  ```matlab
  gpuInfoStruct = gpuDevice;
  ```

### ver
- **Parameters:** none
- **Returns:** table listing installed MATLAB products (`productsTbl`).
- **Side Effects:** prints version information to the console.
- **Usage Example:**
  ```matlab
  productsTbl = ver;
  ```

Subsequent modules rely on this environment. See [Identifier Registry â€“ Data Contracts](identifier_registry.md#data-contracts) for data artifacts produced later in the pipeline.

## Verification
- `gpuInfoStruct` reports a supported GPU and its memory.
- `productsTbl` lists all required toolboxes and the BERT add-on.
