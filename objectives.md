The project’s objective is to help organizations make sense of lengthy banking regulations by automating the process of digesting documents, highlighting important topics, and tracking changes over time.
Purpose
It serves as a toolkit for turning collections of regulation files into organized information. The system reads documents, breaks them into manageable sections, suggests initial topics for each section based on keywords, teaches itself to recognize those topics, and makes the results easy to search and review.

Main Features

Document preparation – Reads regulation files, even when text needs to be extracted from scanned images, then divides the content into small, overlapping sections for easier analysis.
Topic suggestions – Applies keyword rules to propose topics for each section, giving the system a starting point for learning.
Self-learning – Refines these initial suggestions, improving its understanding of each topic and allowing it to tag new sections more accurately.
Search and retrieval – Builds an index that blends traditional word matching with a deeper understanding of meaning, letting users quickly find relevant sections.
Reporting – Generates clear summaries that show how much of each topic is covered, flags sections that may need human review, and lists recurring themes.
Performance checks – Offers tools to compare different learning approaches, monitor quality through metrics like recall and ranking quality, and produce trend charts over time.
Change tracking – Includes utilities to compare different versions of regulations, highlighting additions, removals, and revisions, and compiling the differences into PDF or web reports.
Data synchronization – Can automatically pull the latest regulation files and their associated metadata from official sources.
Optional database support – Stores processed sections along with their predicted topics and scores, enabling later queries or integrations.
Uses
Compliance teams and analysts can use this system to sift through large regulatory texts, quickly locate sections relevant to specific topics, monitor how new versions differ from old ones, and produce concise reports for stakeholders. It reduces the manual effort needed to understand and track evolving regulations, while keeping a clear audit trail of results and evaluations.


data science 

The system automates analysis of lengthy regulatory documents by combining text processing, topic modeling, classification, semantic search, and change detection. The design assumes MATLAB 2024b with Text Analytics, Deep Learning, Statistics, and Database toolboxes.
Overall Goal
Turn PDFs of banking regulations into structured, searchable knowledge. The workflow ingests documents, breaks them into chunks, assigns provisional topics, refines those assignments through statistical models, and enables retrieval, evaluation, and version comparison.
Core Algorithmic Components
1. Document Ingestion
Extract text from PDFs, invoking OCR when no digital text is present.
Output is a table of document IDs, full text, and metadata.
2. Text Segmentation
Split each document into overlapping token windows.
Each chunk retains origin metadata and token span, facilitating later tracing to source passages.
3. Feature Engineering
Lexical features:
Tokenize, remove stop words, lemmatize, drop infrequent terms.
Build TF‑IDF vectors.
Topic features:
Fit an LDA model; each chunk is represented by its topic distribution.
Dense embeddings:
Default: pooled [CLS] output from a base BERT model on GPU.
Fallback: mean‑pooled fastText vectors.
All embeddings are L2‑normalized for cosine similarity.
4. Weak Labeling
Keyword rules generate initial confidence scores for each predefined label.
Scores above a threshold create a “bootstrapped” label matrix for supervised learning.
5. Multilabel Classification
Train one‑vs‑rest logistic regressions (fitclinear) using TF‑IDF, LDA topics, and embeddings.
Models use cross‑validation; per‑label thresholds maximize F1 on the bootstrapped set.
Output: probability scores, calibrated thresholds, and binary predictions for every chunk.
6. Hybrid Search
Build an index blending TF‑IDF cosine similarity and embedding cosine similarity.
Query workflow:
Tokenize and compute query TF‑IDF.
Obtain query embedding via fastText.
Combine lexical and semantic scores with tunable weighting to rank relevant chunks.
7. Contrastive Representation Learning
Triplet generation:
Construct anchor–positive–negative sets based on shared labels or document proximity; negatives share no labels.
Projection head training:
Freeze base embeddings, train a shallow neural head (triplet loss) to improve retrieval.
Encoder fine‑tuning:
Optionally unfreeze top layers of BERT and train end‑to‑end using triplet or supervised contrastive loss.
Supports hard‑negative mining and early stopping based on retrieval metrics.
8. Evaluation Metrics
Retrieval: recall@K, mean average precision, nDCG@K, label co‑retrieval matrices.
Classification: per‑label recall summaries.
Clustering: k‑means on embeddings with purity and silhouette measures.
These metrics guide hyper‑parameter tuning and model comparison across variants.
9. Change Detection
Compare different regulatory corpora by aligning articles and diffing text line‑by‑line.
Summaries record added, removed, unchanged, or modified articles, enabling version tracking.
Usage Outline for Data Scientists
Prepare Data: Ingest PDFs, segment text, build lexical and semantic features.
Bootstrap Labels: Apply keyword rules to generate seed labels.
Train Classifiers: Fit and calibrate multilabel logistic models.
Build Search Index: Combine TF‑IDF matrices and embeddings for hybrid retrieval.
Enhance Embeddings:
Optionally train a projection head or fine‑tune BERT using contrastive losses.
Re‑evaluate retrieval metrics to measure gains.
Deploy & Evaluate: Use retrieval and classification metrics to monitor performance and iterate.
Track Changes: Run article‑level diff utilities when new regulation versions arrive.
